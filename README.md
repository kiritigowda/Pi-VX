# Pi-VX
**OpenVX for Raspberry Pi**

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) is an ultra low cost computer popular among the DIY developers. It's used in a myriad of projects, some for work and some for fun. [OpenVXâ„¢](https://www.khronos.org/openvx/) is an open, royalty-free API standard for cross platform acceleration of computer vision applications. 

OpenVX enables performance and power-optimized computer vision processing, especially important in embedded and real-time use cases such as face, body and gesture tracking, smart video surveillance, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), object and scene reconstruction, augmented reality, visual inspection, robotics and more.
